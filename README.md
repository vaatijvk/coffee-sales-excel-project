Coffee Sales Analysis and Customer Insights Project

Description:
Our Coffee Sales Analysis and Customer Insights Project was an in-depth exploration of our coffee sales data, aimed at uncovering valuable trends, patterns, and customer behaviors that drove informed business decisions and enhanced our overall strategy. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset that included "Order ID," "Order Date," "Product ID," "Quantity," "Customer Name," "Email," "Country," "Coffee Type," "Roast Type," "Size," "Unit Price," "Sales," "Coffee Type Name," "Roast Type Name," and "Loyalty Card," this project delved into various aspects of our coffee business.

Outcomes:
We gained a comprehensive understanding of our coffee sales landscape. Our insights guided product offerings, marketing campaigns, and operational decisions. This project underscored our commitment to data-driven decision-making, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and business growth.
